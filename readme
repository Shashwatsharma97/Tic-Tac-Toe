## 🎯 How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3×3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses **X** and Player 2 uses **O**.
3. Players take turns entering a number (1–9) corresponding to the grid position.
4. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
5. If all positions are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
